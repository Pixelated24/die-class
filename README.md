# die-class
I couldnt figure out how to get make to work on windows. It compiled with the code and it just didnt stay open. Just open then instantly close. I am unable to check it on linux right now. But if this will be a big problem in the future I can download a VM on a usb and use that but I dont want to do that if I dont have to.
